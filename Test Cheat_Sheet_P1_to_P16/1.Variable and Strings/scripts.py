
#Variables and Strings

##Variables are used to store values. A string is a series of characters, surrounded by single or double quotes.

###Hello world

print("Hello world!")



###Hello world with a variable

msg = "Hello world!"
print(msg)


###Concatenation (combining strings)

first_name = 'albert'
last_name = 'einstein'
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)
